    <h1>My Resume</h1>
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>It is all about experience, even If you study. So what you are doing, for how long, and how you are doing it, creates the  real you. In my case; life has been good. Alone being born in one country and moving to other, has it's own advantages. At a very young Age Sales was something I learnt in the Family business. The principle of what is in demand, is that what costs more is what I have learnt very early in life. Doing sport has taught me what disciplin is. And being a believer has taught me that one can not lag behind if he believes in it.</p>
    <h2>Education</h2>
